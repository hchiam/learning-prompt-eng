- Nails cost $1 per box.
- You need 1 boxes of nails per 10 meter of planks.

|step|subquestion|procedure|result|
|1|what is total cost?|total overall = planks cost + nails cost + labor cost|$?|
|2|what is planks cost?|total planks cost = $5/m * 30 m = $5 * (30 m / 1 m) = $150|$150|
|3|what is nails cost?|total nails cost = ($1 / box) * (1 box / 10 m) * 30 m = ($1 / 1 box) * (1 box / 10 m) * 30 m = $1 / 10 m * 30 m = $1 * (30 m / 10 m) = $1 * (30/10) = $1 * 3 = $3|$3|
|4|what is labor cost?|total labor cost = $20/hour * labor hours|$?|
|5|what is labor hours?|total labor hours = 20 hours but if boxes of nails > 1 then meters of planks + nails cost|? hours|
|6|what is boxes of nails?|total boxes of nails = 1 box of nails / 10 m * 30 m = 1 box * 30m/10m = 1 * 3 = 3 boxes|3 boxes|
|7|what is labor hours?|since boxes of nails is 3 which is > 1 then total labor hours = 30 meters of planks + $3 nails cost = 30 + 3 = 33 hours|33 hours|
|8|what is labor cost?|total labor cost = $20/hour * labor hours = $20 / 1 hour * 33 hours = $20 * (33 hours / 1 hour) = $20 * 33/1 = $20 * 33 = $660|$660|
|9|what is total cost?|total overall = planks cost + nails cost + labor cost = $150 + $3 + $660 = $813|$813|

Final answer: the total estimated cost for the small volunteer project is $813.
